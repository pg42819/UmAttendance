MEI Schedule Android App
========================

Students attending the MEI and MIEI courses at Minho University
are provided with a free Android app, “MEI Schedule”
(meant to sound a bit like “my schedule”)
The app uses geolocation sensors in the Android device to collect
information about whether users are on campus during lesson times.

The data is submitted (without personally identifying information)
to a backend web-based service, where it is correlated with other
“virtual” sensor data, from public APIs, to determine what factors might influence a student’s in-presence attendance.
In particular, the current rate of Covid-19 cases in the geographic
area around the campus is collected for correlation.

The “virtual” sensor, in this case, is a public API provided by the DGS
(Portuguese Public Health Directorate)
